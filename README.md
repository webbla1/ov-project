Given the requirements, we will need the following core components:

1. A form component to collect user inputs.
2. A function to handle form submission and generate the OpenAI prompt.
3. A function to make the API call to OpenAI.
4. A function to handle the response from OpenAI and format it for the frontend.

Let's start with the entry point file, which is usually `index.js` in a Next.js application.
